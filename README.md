# Topic
Exploring diverent reasons for the rising popularity of the "Deutschrap" genre in Germany over the last 10 years.

### Background

NEEDS TO BE ADDED

### Hypothesis
1. The audio features of deutsch rap tracks became more similar to the audio features of tracks found in the top100 German charts from 2010-2021
2. The gender distribution of deutsch rap artists changed significantly from 2010-2021
   -> Which made it more appealing to female listeners to dive into the genre.
3. The word-use in deutsch rap tracks changed significantly from 2010-2021
   -> Which opened up the group of listeners to adults, parents allowing kids/teenagers to listen/buy music, females.

<br/>ALINE LINKS UNDER THE ICONS!

# Key Take Aways
- The **share of german rap** tracks in the weekly german top 100 charts increased by 36% from 2010 to 2020.
- The **average dancebility** of german rap tracks overtook the average dancebility of other top100 tracks from other genres from 2015 on wards.
- There are 1100% more **album releases** in 2020 compared to 2010 from the female german rap artists sample.
- **Words** such as 'baby' and 'love' are more frequently used in 2020 german rap tracks within the german top 100 charts.

All of the key take aways from above lead me to the conclusion, that the german rap genre opened up to a wider audiences. The rising number of female rap artists might have attrackted more female listeners. The increased dancebility might have drawn listeners of pop music to try out german rap. Listeners who have been put off by the word-use in rap tracks from previous years might now .

**Outlook**
<br/>Further reasearch on the development of listener profiles/demographics of german rap will be necessary to validate these claims.
