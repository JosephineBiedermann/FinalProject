# Topic
Exploring diverent reasons for the rising popularity of the "Deutschrap" genre in Germany over the last 10 years.

### Background

### Hypothesis
1. The audio features of deutsch rap tracks became more similar to the audio features of tracks found in the top100 German charts from 2010-2021
2. The word-use in deutsch rap tracks changed significantly from 2010-2021
   -> Which opened up the group of listeners to adults, parents allowing kids/teenagers to listen/buy music, females.
4. The gender distribution of deutsch rap artists changed significantly from 2010-2021
   -> Which made it more appealing to female listeners to dive into the genre.
5. The images displayed on deutsch rap album or track covers changed from 2010-2021
   -> Again here, more kid and female friendly.
