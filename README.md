# Topic
Exploring diverent reasons for the rising popularity of the "Deutschrap" genre in Germany over the last 10 years.

### Background

German rap music is all over the place nowerdays. We see german rap artists on bilboards advertising the newest nike shoes, we encounter their tracks in movie soundtracks and we can even buy foods and drinks from their own brands. The most famous artists like Capital Bra and 187 Stra√üenbande are even known by our parents, which was unthinkable 10 years ago. But when and how did the phenomenon "Deutschrap" started and became as popular as it is today? 
<br/>As a listener of Deutschrap myself I was always curious to find out more. So when the opportunity arose to choose an instresting topic for the final project of the Data Analytics Bootcamp from IRONHACK, I knew immediatly what I wanted to do.

### Hypothesis
1. The audio features of deutsch rap tracks became more similar to the audio features of tracks found in the top100 German charts from 2010-2021
2. The gender distribution of deutsch rap artists changed significantly from 2010-2021
3. The word-use in deutsch rap tracks changed significantly from 2010-2021

# Key Take Aways
- The **share of german rap** tracks in the weekly german top 100 charts increased by 36% from 2010 to 2020.
- The **average dancebility** of german rap tracks overtook the average dancebility of other top100 tracks from other genres from 2015 on wards.
- There are 1100% more **album releases** in 2020 compared to 2010 from the female german rap artists sample.
- **Words** such as 'baby' and 'love' are more frequently used in 2020 german rap tracks within the german top 100 charts.
<br/> **find the full presentation [here](https://slides.com/josephinebiedermann/deck-8dbfaa/edit)

All of the key take aways from above lead me to the conclusion, that the german rap genre opened up to a wider audiences. The rising number of female rap artists might have attrackted more female listeners. The increased dancebility might have drawn listeners of pop music to try out german rap. Listeners who have been put off by the word-use in rap tracks from previous years might now .

<br/>

**Outlook**
<br/>Further reasearch on the development of listener profiles/demographics of german rap will be necessary to validate these claims.

# 
**Disclaimer**
<br/>Due to the time constrict for the final project (5 working days), the numbers, over all outcome and conclusions are made only on a sample data set. I am not speaking for the whole majority of the German Deutschrap genre. Please view this project and analysis as a peak into the topic. The data will be biased to a certain degree, as I had to clean and wrangle them.
